# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game
# Note, I used this (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prof-rossetti/my-first-python-app/main/README.md) as an outline to create this README file
## Prerequisites

  + Anaconda 3.7+
  + Python 3.7+
  + Pip
## Installation

Fork this [remote repository](https://github.com/RyanK53/Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game) to put it under your own control and then clone it to download it onto your local computer

Now navigate to where you saved the file using the command line

Now use Anaconda to create a new virtual environment, maybe name it "rock-paper-scissors-env":

conda create -n rock-paper-scissors-env python=3.8
conda activate rock-paper-scissors-env

After activating the virtual environment, install package dependencies (see the ["requirements.txt"]file):
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Setup

In the root directory of your local repository, create a new file called ".env", now update the contents of the file to specify your preferred user name, make sure to save the file once you are finished editing it

    PLAYER_NAME="PLAYER_NAME"

python app/my_script.py
